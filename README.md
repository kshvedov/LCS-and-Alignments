LCS and Alignments

The project was complete with a friend and classmate Adam Possing.

The 2 goals of the project was to write an longest commen substring (LCS) algorithem that finds one between two inputed strings and to make an alignment algorithm that produces a score for similarrity. The LCS algorithem constructs a tree and uses a colouring methodology to determine the LCS. The project idea was created by our teacher, in the attempt to help us understand more about different viruses and COVID.

Multiple strings can be inputed and all of them are compared using LCS and Alignment.
